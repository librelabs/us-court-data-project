# US Court Data Project

This repo is a space to gather software and some data that enriches or enhances the US Court Data, including augmenting the Free Law Project with data that is currently outside of their interest. The status of this project is proof of concept and we recommend checking out the [Free Law Projects](https://free.law/) currently available (and awesome) solutions.
